This project was born from the collaboration of several companies, combining their expertise and knowledge to create a new product-as-a-service. By integrating **neuroscience** and **artificial intelligence**, we aim to transform the way media content is consumed, bridging the gap between consumers and producers


## The principal goals of the project are: ##

-- Enable consumers to earn money by watching videos.

-- Allow media producers to upload their creations and share them with a community of reviewers.

-- Collect information about consumers, including their facial expressions, opinions, and assessments.

-- Process the collected information using breakthrough technologies.

-- Provide producers with powerful insights to make informed decisions before launching their products.
